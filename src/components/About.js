    <div className="about-container">
      <p>
        I am an aspiring Software Engineer currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma in Information Technology (HNDIT). 
        Passionate about building scalable applications and contributing to innovative projects, I bring hands-on experience 
        from academic and freelance work. I am eager to apply my skills in real-world environments and continuously expand my 
        expertise in full-stack development.  
        <br></br> <br></br>  <br></br>

        I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Java, 
        and Spring Boot. My experience also extends to working with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. Beyond coding, 
        I enjoy exploring UI/UX design principles to create intuitive and engaging user experiences.  
  <br></br> <br></br>  <br></br>
        As a proactive learner, I consistently stay updated with emerging technologies and best practices in software 
        development. I thrive in collaborative team environments, enjoy problem-solving, and am always ready to take on 
        challenging projects that allow me to grow and contribute effectively.  
  <br></br> <br></br>  <br></br>
        In addition to technical skills, I possess excellent communication, time management, and organizational abilities. 
        I have successfully managed small projects from conception to deployment, ensuring timely delivery and high-quality 
        results. I also enjoy mentoring peers, sharing knowledge, and learning from experienced professionals in the field.  
  <br></br> <br></br>  <br></br>
        Outside of programming, I have a keen interest in technology trends, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. 
        I also value creativity and enjoy photography and digital media projects, which enhance my design perspective and 
        attention to detail.  
  <br></br> <br></br>  <br></br>
        My ultimate goal is to become a versatile software engineer capable of building innovative, user-centric solutions 
        that make a meaningful impact. I am committed to continuous growth, learning, and contributing positively to any 
        team or project I am part of.
